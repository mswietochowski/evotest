Proof of Concept evolutionary algorithm for 3D graph visualisation.

Hardocded graph with 4 vertices and 3 edges, all in 0,0,0 at the
beginning. Quality of code is below poor, but it works, and that's
what matters at the moment.

If you don't have imagination powerful enough to see that the
resulting vertices' coordinates are quite OK, the last 4 lines of
output serves as an input to physics-opengl by Micha≈Ç Nazarewicz
(http://github.com/mina86/physics-opengl).

Running scenario:
../../evotest/dist/evotest | tail -n 4 | ./physics

Have fun.
